# Advanced Tools for Computational Materials Science

## Introduction:

In Undergraduate or in Postgraduate we often study materials science as a series of other subjects like solid state or condensed mater physics, electrodynamics, thermodynamics extra. These all basic physics subjects can be combined as materials and their properties. Usually materials science includes fabrication, structural confirmation and properties analysis. For which both experimental and theoretical studies can be used. Here we will briefly see the importance of structure and how to obtain it, followed by the tools that can be used for that. Then, if we have a material with known structure, we can experimentally study its properties. Alternatively using the structure we can simulate its properties which can be used to estimate its potentiality as well as can be used to inter-correlate with the experimental results for better understanding. Here we will use density functional theory (DFT) to optimise the geometry and to simulate the FTIR, Raman, UV absorption and emission spectroscopy. Then we will use semi-empirical PM7 method to simulate nonlinear optical properties of some nanoclusters.

## Cell Refinement:

Crystals are the important arena of condensed matter physics and materials science. The properties of the materials are often described based on their crystalline structure. Ideally, crystals are formed by the repeating basic units called ‘unit cells’, over the three dimensional space. Which means, if you look into a crystal from any direction, it resembles same over the space. This is only in the case of ideal crystals. But practically, due to the experimental limitations, crystals have some defects in their structure. Analysing such a defects are important, especially when we consider the crystal for applications. There are many methods and programs are available to estimate the defects and to refine the crystal structure in literature. Here we use two of such programs to demonstrate the cell refinement process.
